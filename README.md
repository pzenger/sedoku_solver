To use: 
Create a file to contain the initial board.
For each empty spot place a 0, for each filled spot place the number.
Fill the file with 9x9 characters.
Edit the file_name variable in the __main__ method to match the file name.
Run the program.
Solution will be in[you're file_name].sol

*Not thoroughly tested, may not work on all boards.
